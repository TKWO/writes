The clouds shifted and suddenly revealed the sun, flooding the room with light. It caught his attention for a moment.
He gazed outside, his mind as devoid of thought as it possibly could be.
Joyful laughter from some passer-by children he registered subconciously, but it failed to provoke any rational thought.
The neighbouring building, despite its decrepid condition, sat there in hyper saturated colors, almost blinding him.
The clouds shifted again. The light vanished, removing the saturation from the outside world in sync with the joyful laughter fading into the distance.
A wave of Depression slammed into him. "Now that's much more befitting" he thought to himself, smirking the faintest of smiles. Weirdly, this cheered him up.
With a whistle a slight draft of cold air hit him, creeping through the cap between the poorly fitted window and the wall.
He sighed audibly, he knew it was time to go.

But go and do what? 

It was an urge, an emotion, not tied to any actual rational plan his mind was able to call up.
He was restless. Something had to be done, but what? He felt like a senile, yet there wasn't anything to forget in the first place.
His eyes scanned his surroundings while he searched his mind. His stomach assisted by grumbling. "Food" he rumbled to himself, not sounding terribly convincing.
On a second thought, he wasn't that hungry and cooking seemed like an awful lot of effort. His eyes landed on the floor.
It certainly could be cleaner, but he had swept it yesterday, and any more effort seemed absurdly excessive to him.
Another wave of depression hit him together with his next thought.

Work.

Ah yes, there was work.
He stared out of the window again.
